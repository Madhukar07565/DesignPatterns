## Design Patterns

### Singleton Design Pattern

Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only
one instance of the class exists in the java virtual machine.

Example of creating singleton design pattern is present under the singleton directory.

### Factory Design Pattern

Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple subclasses
and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This
pattern take out the responsibility of instantiation of a class from client
program to the factory class.
